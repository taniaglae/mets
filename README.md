## MetS

This work aims to identify the most relevant features to propose a risk predictor for the early detection of people with MetS (metabolic syndrome) through machine learning algorithms and deep learning.

There are two files with example data for women and men; when the experiment proposes a complete dataset, a merge of both is needed.

The code in METS_DL.ipynb is set to train the proposed deep learning model for each *.csv.
